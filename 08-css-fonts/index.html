      <p>
        Apple's T2 Security Chip gets itself in the way as much as possible when attempting to install Linux on a
        <span>Mid 2019 Macbook</span> Pro and a lot of the available documentation for Linux-on-the-mac online is
        pre-T2. After quite a bit of back and forth and eventually finding the right resources I managed to get Ubuntu
        installed on my MacBook Pro with everything working... except the microphone.

        Getting started with this process was a bit of a <span>minefield</span>. The first resource I came across was
        How to Install and Dual-Boot Linux and macOS, an extremely detailed and useful documentation piece with one
        minor caveat (that I didn't take heed of initially):
